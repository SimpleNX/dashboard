# dashboard
An Admin Dashboard

## What is the page about

The page is a general admin dashboard for social media app, or a general
co-op sort of website.


## What have I learnt and implemented

I have learnt to use Grid Styling to arrange divs in grids across the page, and also
using advanced CSS selectors to select elements without having to specifically name every one of them.
